This folder contains PDFs of the 2016 version of Form 990(PC), Form 990EZ, Form 990PF, and all Scheduled. 


Major revisions to Form 990 [were made in 2008 and took effect in 2010](https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2009/aug/revisedform990theevolutionofgovernanceandthenonprofitworld.html), but the form has been mostly consistent since then with most changes effecting instructions and not the form itself with a few minor exceptions ([for example](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/tax/library/2021-form-990-contains-a-couple-of-notable-changes.html)). 

The 

Location codes describe the location of fields on the paper version of 990 form. These should be consistent between years 2010 and current forms since few changes were made so these archived 2016 forms are fine for reference across all years, but if in doubt you can look up old versions of forms on the IRS site:

That said, efile schemas and fields have evolved each year and sometimes differ slightly from 990 fields (room for additional entries, occassionally an extra field). 

When creating data dictionaries we use the full Form 990 (PC for public charity) as the reference for location codes (the location of a field on the form), and 990-EZ fields are mapped to the corresponding 990 fields.
