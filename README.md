# IRS Efile Master Concordance File

The Master Concordance File, available in CSV version here, defines standards and provides documentation necessary to build structured databases from the IRS E-File XML files posted on AWS.

The IRS [released the 990 e-file data as XML documents](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/irs-990/) in 2016 with little documentation. The MCF provides standards and conventions to assist the work of programmers that wish to utlize the data.

The MCF is meant to serve as a rosetta stone of sorts, allowing programmers to convert XML documents into a structured database by mapping 10,000 unique xpaths onto a data dictionary.

Follow the [MCF DOCUMENTATION](https://nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/irs-efile-master-concordance-file/) link for an overview of informaton contained within the Master Concordance File.
