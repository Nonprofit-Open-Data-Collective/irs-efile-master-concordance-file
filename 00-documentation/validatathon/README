To generate Validatathon assets:

(1) Create a master data set by using:
   https://github.com/CharityNavigator/990_long
   
(2) Partition the master data set into .csv files using 990_long/split_csv.py.

(3) version_count.csv, in this directory, was generated ad-hoc at an interactive
    terminal. It represents a count of all 990 in the data set by version.
    
(4) Use generate.R to create detail reports. You will need to tweak the number
    of partitions, the input source, and the output destination to get it to run
    on your particular machine. This also generates the "report of reports" for
    these detail reports.
  
(5) Use examples.R to identify examples for each xpath.

(7) Manually combine the xpath report and the report of reports into a 
    spreadsheet; format as desired.
